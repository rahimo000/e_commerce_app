# Cursor Rules

## Instructions

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[X]` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.

## Lessons
- When implementing authentication, prefer bcryptjs over bcrypt for better portability and easier deployment across different environments
- Always update both runtime dependencies and their corresponding type definitions (@types/*) when switching packages
- When implementing role-based access control, extend NextAuth types to include custom fields like 'role'
